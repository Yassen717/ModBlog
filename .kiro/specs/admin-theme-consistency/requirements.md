# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The admin panel currently has inconsistent dark mode and light mode theming. While the app has a theme context system and settings page with theme controls, the admin panel components don't properly respect the theme changes, leading to poor user experience and accessibility issues. This feature will ensure consistent theming across all admin panel components and provide a seamless theme switching experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the admin panel to consistently apply dark/light mode themes across all components, so that I have a cohesive visual experience regardless of my theme preference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user changes the theme in the settings page THEN all admin panel components SHALL immediately reflect the new theme
2. WHEN the system theme preference changes THEN the admin panel SHALL automatically update to match the system preference if "system" theme is selected
3. WHEN navigating between different admin pages THEN the theme SHALL remain consistent across all pages
4. WHEN the page is refreshed THEN the admin panel SHALL maintain the previously selected theme

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want proper contrast and readability in both dark and light modes, so that I can effectively manage content regardless of lighting conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the admin panel in dark mode THEN all text SHALL have sufficient contrast against dark backgrounds
2. WHEN viewing the admin panel in light mode THEN all text SHALL have sufficient contrast against light backgrounds
3. WHEN hovering over interactive elements THEN the hover states SHALL be clearly visible in both themes
4. WHEN focusing on form elements THEN the focus indicators SHALL be clearly visible in both themes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the theme toggle to be easily accessible within the admin panel, so that I can quickly switch themes without navigating to the settings page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any admin panel page THEN a theme toggle control SHALL be visible in the top navigation
2. WHEN clicking the theme toggle THEN the theme SHALL change immediately without page refresh
3. WHEN the theme changes THEN the toggle control SHALL update to reflect the current theme state
4. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the theme toggle SHALL be accessible via keyboard

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want all admin panel components (cards, buttons, forms, tables) to properly support both themes, so that no component appears broken or inconsistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing dashboard cards THEN they SHALL have appropriate background colors and borders for the current theme
2. WHEN viewing data tables THEN row striping and borders SHALL be visible in both themes
3. WHEN viewing form elements THEN input fields, dropdowns, and buttons SHALL have proper styling in both themes
4. WHEN viewing navigation elements THEN active states and hover effects SHALL work correctly in both themes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the theme preference to persist across browser sessions, so that I don't have to reset my theme choice every time I log in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting a theme preference THEN it SHALL be saved to localStorage
2. WHEN returning to the admin panel in a new session THEN the previously selected theme SHALL be applied
3. WHEN the theme context updates THEN the admin panel SHALL synchronize with the global theme state
4. IF no theme preference exists THEN the system SHALL default to the system preference or light mode
