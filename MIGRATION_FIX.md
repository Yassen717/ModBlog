# 🔧 Quick Fix: Image Migration Issue

## Problem
You're seeing an error about Unsplash images not being configured because your browser has cached the old data with external image URLs.

## ✅ Solution Options

### Option 1: Automatic Migration (Recommended - Easiest)
Simply **refresh your browser page** (F5 or Ctrl+R). The code now automatically detects old Unsplash URLs and replaces them with local images!

### Option 2: Use the Data Reset Tool (Guaranteed Fix)
1. Navigate to: **http://localhost:3000/admin/data-reset**
2. Click the **"Full Reset"** button
3. Wait for the confirmation message
4. The page will automatically redirect to the admin dashboard

### Option 3: Manual Browser Console (For Advanced Users)
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to the Console tab
3. Paste and run this command:
```javascript
localStorage.clear(); location.reload();
```

## 🎯 What Happens
The migration code will:
1. ✅ Detect old Unsplash URLs in localStorage
2. ✅ Remove the old data
3. ✅ Load fresh sample data with local images
4. ✅ All images now point to `/public/images/`

## 📍 Access the Data Reset Tool
- **URL**: http://localhost:3000/admin/data-reset
- **Navigation**: Admin Panel → Data Reset (in the sidebar)

## 🔍 Verify It Worked
After resetting, you should see:
- ✅ All blog post images loading from local files
- ✅ Author avatars showing local images
- ✅ No "unconfigured host" errors
- ✅ Console message: "Sample data initialized/migrated"

## 📝 Technical Details
The migration happens in `lib/sample-data.ts` in the `initializeSampleData()` function, which:
- Checks for Unsplash URLs in existing data
- Automatically replaces them with local image paths
- Updates localStorage with the new paths

## 🚀 Next Steps
Once the images are fixed, you can:
1. Browse your blog posts with local images
2. Create new posts (they'll use local images by default)
3. Customize which images are used in `lib/sample-data.ts`
